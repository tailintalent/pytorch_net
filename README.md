# pytorch_net

This repository provides classes for efficient construction of neural networks with PyTorch, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), LSTM, and model ensembles. It also provides easy manipulation of networks, including addition and removal of layers and neurons. See tutorial.ipynb for a simple demonstration.
