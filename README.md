# pytorch_net

This repository provides classes for efficient construction of neural networks with PyTorch, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), LSTM, CNN and model ensembles. It also provides easy manipulation of networks, including addition and removal of layers and neurons, loading and saving models as a dictionary. See tutorial.ipynb for a simple demonstration.


## Requirements:
- [PyTorch >= 0.4.1](https://pytorch.org/)
- scikit-learn
