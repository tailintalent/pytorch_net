# pytorch_net

This repository provides classes for efficient construction of neural networks with PyTorch, including multilayer perceptron (MLP), LSTM, CNN, WideResNet, model ensembles, etc. It also provides easy manipulation of networks, including addition and removal of layers and neurons, training of networks, simplification of networks, loading and saving models as a dictionary. See [tutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/tailintalent/pytorch_net/blob/master/Tutorial.ipynb) for a simple demonstration.


## Requirements:
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) >= 0.4.1
- scikit-learn
